<h1>Sphynx Cats</h1>

<p>The Sphynx cat is a breed of cat known for its lack of coat (fur). Hairlessness in cats is a naturally occurring genetic mutation; however, the Sphynx cat, as a breed, was developed through selective breeding, starting in the 1960s.[1] The skin should have the texture of chamois leather, as it has fine hairs, or the cat may be completely hairless. Whiskers may be present, either whole or broken, or may be totally absent. The cats have a narrow, long head and webbed feet. Their skin is the color that their fur would be, and all the usual cat markings (solid, point, van, tabby, tortie, etc.) may be found on the Sphynx cat's skin. Because they have no fur they lose more body heat than coated cats which makes them warm to the touch and prone to finding warm places.</p>

<h2>History of the Cat Breed</h2>
<h3>Toronto</h3>
<p>The Canadian Sphynx breed was started in 1966 in Toronto, Ontario when a hairless kitten named Prune was born to a black and white domestic shorthair queen (Elizabeth).[6] The kitten was mated with its mother (something called backcrossing), which produced one more naked kitten. Together with a few naked kittens found later, the cat Prune was the first attempt to create a hairless breed.</p>
<h3>Minnesota</h3>
<p>The first noted naturally occurring foundation Sphynx originated as hairless stray barn cats in Wadena, Minnesota, at the farm of Milt and Ethelyn Pearson.[5] The Pearsons identified hairless kittens occurring in several litters of their domestic shorthair barn cats in the mid-1970s.[5] Two hairless female kittens born in 1975 and 1976, Epidermis and Dermis, were sold to Oregon breeder Kim Mueske, and became an important part of the Sphynx breeding program.[9][5] Also working with the Pearson line of cats was breeder Georgiana Gattenby of Brainerd, Minnesota, who outcrossed with Cornish Rex cats.[9]</p>
