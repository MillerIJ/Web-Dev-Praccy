        <p>The <b>Sphynx cat</b> is a breed of cat known for its lack of <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_coat">coat</a> (fur). Hairlessness in cats is a naturally
            occurring genetic mutation; however, the Sphynx cat, as a breed, was developed through selective breeding,
            starting in the 1960s.<sup><a href="link.com">[1]</a></sup> The skin should have the texture of chamois
            leather,
            as it has fine hairs, or the cat
            may be completely hairless. Whiskers may be present, either whole or broken, or may be totally absent. The
            cats
            have a narrow, long head and webbed feet. Their skin is the color that their fur would be, and all the usual
            cat
            markings (solid, point, van, tabby, tortie, etc.) may be found on the Sphynx cat's skin. Because they have
            no
            fur they lose more body heat than coated cats which makes them warm to the touch and prone to finding warm
            places.</p>

            <h2>History of the Cat Breed</h2>
            <h3>Toronto</h3>
            <p>The Canadian Sphynx breed was started in 1966 in Toronto, Ontario when a hairless kitten named Prune was
                born
                to
                a black and white domestic shorthair queen (Elizabeth).[6] The kitten was mated with its mother
                (something
                called backcrossing), which produced one more naked kitten. Together with a few naked kittens found
                later,
                the
                cat Prune was the first attempt to create a hairless breed.</p>
            <h3>Minnesota</h3>
            <p>The first noted naturally occurring foundation Sphynx originated as hairless stray barn cats in Wadena,
                Minnesota, at the farm of Milt and Ethelyn Pearson.[5] The Pearsons identified hairless kittens
                occurring in
                several litters of their domestic shorthair barn cats in the mid-1970s.[5] Two hairless female kittens
                born
                in
                1975 and 1976, Epidermis and Dermis, were sold to Oregon breeder Kim Mueske, and became an important
                part of
                the
                Sphynx breeding program.[9][5] Also working with the Pearson line of cats was breeder Georgiana Gattenby
                of
                Brainerd, Minnesota, who outcrossed with Cornish Rex cats.[9]</p>
